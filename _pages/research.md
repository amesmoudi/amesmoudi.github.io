## Research

My research focuses on efficient RDF data management and querying within knowledge graphs, aiming to balance scalability and performance in SPARQL evaluations over large datasets. Beyond standard graph matching, I work on natively integrating spatio-temporal capabilities into Triplestores.

Within the [RDF_QDAG project](https://qdag.projets.univ-poitiers.fr/qdag/) {% cite SaidiYMBHM22 %}, we propose handling RDF through logical graph fragmentation and exploration {% cite GaliciaMB19 KhelilMGBHC21 %}, supporting not only Basic Graph Patterns (BGPs) but also wildcard and spatial filtering {% cite YousfiMHMB23 %}. Optimization strategies {% cite NadirWise24 ZouaghiMGBA21 %} are integrated to minimize intensive joins during query evaluations. Currently, we are evolving RDF_QDAG to support cluster-based architectures using the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model.

Additionally, work is underway on optimizing anomaly detection in large graphs. {% cite MansouriBMHMBC23 %}

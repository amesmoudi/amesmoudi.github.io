## Research

My research focuses on efficient RDF data management and querying within knowledge graphs, aiming to balance scalability and performance in SPARQL evaluations over large datasets. Beyond standard graph matching, I work on natively integrating spatio-temporal capabilities into Triplestores.

Within the [RDF_QDAG project](https://qdag.projets.univ-poitiers.fr/qdag/), we propose handling RDF through logical graph fragmentation and exploration, supporting not only Basic Graph Patterns (BGPs) but also wildcard and spatial filtering. Optimization strategies are integrated to minimize intensive joins during query evaluations. Currently, we are evolving RDF_QDAG to support cluster-based architectures using the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model.

Additionally, work is underway on optimizing anomaly detection in large graphs.

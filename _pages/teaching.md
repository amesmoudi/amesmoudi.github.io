## Teaching and Pedagogical Responsibilities

My teaching activities focus on data management, particularly the exploitation of Big Data. Most of my teaching duties are carried out within the [Data Science Department](https://iutp.univ-poitiers.fr/sd) of the [IUT of Poitiers-Niort-Châtellerault](https://iutp.univ-poitiers.fr) ([Niort campus](https://niort.univ-poitiers.fr/)). I also contribute to the [Master's program in Computer Science](https://formations.univ-poitiers.fr/fr/index/master-XB/master-XB/master-informatique-JAJEEY0P.html) of the [Faculty of Fundamental and Applied Sciences (SFA)](https://sfa.univ-poitiers.fr/) at the [University of Poitiers](https://www.univ-poitiers.fr/), where I teach a course on Big Data. This course has been extended to the engineering students of [ISAE-ENSMA](https://www.ensma.fr/).

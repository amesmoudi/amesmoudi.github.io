Amin Mesmoudi
======

I have been an Associate Professor (Maître de Conférences) in Computer Science at the [Data Science Department](https://iutp.univ-poitiers.fr/sd) of the [IUT of Poitiers-Niort-Châtellerault](https://iutp.univ-poitiers.fr), [University of Poitiers](https://www.univ-poitiers.fr/en/), since September 2016. I am also a member of the IDD team at the [LIAS Laboratory](https://www.lias-lab.fr/en/). In addition, I coordinate the [RDF_QDAG project](https://qdag.projets.univ-poitiers.fr/), which focuses on developing a TripleStore that ensures a balance between scalability and performance. Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [LIRIS](https://liris.cnrs.fr/) from 2015 to 2016. I obtained my PhD in 2015 from [Claude Bernard University Lyon 1](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/), under the supervision of [Mohand-Saïd Hacid](https://perso.univ-lyon1.fr/mohand-said.hacid/). My research focuses on scalable RDF query processing, graph-based optimization, and data mining, particularly in the context of knowledge graphs and large-scale data management.
